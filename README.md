# ReputationGUI

This is a **minecraft plugin** (developed for **SpigotMC** on the spigotapi **1.19-R0.1-SNAPSHOT**) so that player have their own **reputation status**.
- Other players can alter another player's reputation status by adding or removing one point.
- The player cannot alter their own reputation.
- Players with operator status (view permissions bellow) may set an offset to the player's reputation
    - Artificial reputation set by operator commands will be considered as the player giving themselves said reputation.


## Sidenote

This is a plugin that has been requested by a third party client and therefore heavily attuned to his demands in regards of **features** and **budget**.
This includes and is not limited to:
- Possibly incomplete documentation
- Untested Placeholder's API functionality
- Workarounds
- Not optimized database inserts (database calls are still done in async)
- Poor gui customization

Although it being open source due said client's request, this **may not** receive as much **public** support as it would if it was a work that was not sold.
This still does not mean you have to keep it buggy. Please open an issue on github or fork this if you encounter any problem.
